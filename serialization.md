are there other ways to put data into vector? i want to also use the same function for non-primitive datatypes such as structs. and the game is intended to run on 64bit systems (windows 10/11 for clients, linux arch/ubuntu for server), so that shouldnt be a problem no?

Yes, there are other ways to put data into a `std::vector<Uint8>`, especially when working with non-primitive types such as structs. For 64-bit systems, you don't typically have to worry about issues like pointer size differences (which would affect 32-bit systems), but you still need to ensure correct byte ordering and memory alignment when dealing with complex data types.

Given that your application is meant to run on 64-bit systems (Windows 10/11 and Linux), byte alignment should be handled correctly, but byte order still matters for cross-platform network communication.
General Overview:

    Primitive Types: You can append these types directly as you were doing.
    Complex Types (Structs, Classes): For structs or other custom types, you can serialize the struct into a raw byte stream and append it to the vector.

Let's break this down into two cases: Primitive Types and Custom Types (like structs).
1. Appending Primitive Data Types:

For primitive data types (like int, float, double), we can continue using `std::memcpy`, or we can use more explicit type-specific functions for byte order conversion (htonl(), htons(), etc.).

Here's an example for appending primitive types:
```c++
template<typename T>
void PacketData::append(T data) {
    // Convert to network byte order (if needed) for multi-byte types (like int, float)
    if constexpr (sizeof(T) == 2) { // For 16-bit types
        data = htons(data);
    } else if constexpr (sizeof(T) == 4) { // For 32-bit types
        data = htonl(data);
    } else if constexpr (sizeof(T) == 8) { // For 64-bit types
        data = htobe64(data);
    }

    // Resize vector and append the data
    size_t current_size = this->data.size();
    this->data.resize(current_size + sizeof(T));
    std::memcpy(&this->data[current_size], &data, sizeof(T)); // append data
}
```

For example, if `T` is an `int`, and the system is little-endian, you can convert it to big-endian using `htonl()` before appending it to the vector.
2. Appending Structs or Other Complex Types:

For structs or classes, you can follow a similar approach, but instead of directly copying the data, you need to serialize it (convert it into a raw byte stream) and append it.
Example: Appending a Struct

Let's assume you have a struct like this:
```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;
    float value;
};
```

To append this struct to a vector, you'd need to serialize it into a byte stream. One option is to use `std::memcpy` to copy the entire struct into the vector, but make sure to handle alignment and byte ordering properly.

```c++
template<typename T>
void PacketData::append(const T& data) {
    // Convert each field of the struct if needed (e.g., for network byte order)
    if constexpr (std::is_same<T, MyStruct>::value) {
        MyStruct serializedData = data;

        // Ensure proper byte order for each field
        serializedData.id = htonl(serializedData.id);
        serializedData.value = htonl(*reinterpret_cast<int*>(&serializedData.value)); // Handle float, or use a different method to serialize floats

        // Append the struct as raw bytes
        size_t current_size = this->data.size();
        this->data.resize(current_size + sizeof(T));
        std::memcpy(&this->data[current_size], &serializedData, sizeof(T));
    }
    else {
        // If it's a generic type, handle as usual
        size_t current_size = this->data.size();
        this->data.resize(current_size + sizeof(T));
        std::memcpy(&this->data[current_size], &data, sizeof(T));
    }
}
```

Key Notes:

    Alignment: Ensure that the data is properly aligned when copying it. On modern compilers and platforms, the default alignment should be correct for simple types, but if your struct contains pointers or non-trivial types, you may need to handle alignment manually.
    Byte Order (Endianness): For network communication, converting the data to network byte order (big-endian) is important. You can use the htonl() function for 32-bit integers, htons() for 16-bit, and htobe64() for 64-bit. For floating point values, it’s more complex and may require custom serialization (e.g., converting them to an integer representation before sending).

3. Using std::vector for Non-Primitive Types:

The `std::vector<Uint8>` can store anything in byte form, as long as you serialize the data first. A more general approach would be to write a specialized serialization function for each custom type you intend to send.

Here’s an example of how you might handle a simple struct serialization:

```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;
    float value;

    // Serialize the struct into a byte stream
    void serialize(std::vector<Uint8>& out) const {
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(id));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(id)], &id, sizeof(id));

        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(value));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(value)], &value, sizeof(value));
    }
};

// Use this function to append MyStruct to the vector
void PacketData::append(const MyStruct& data) {
    data.serialize(this->data); // Use the struct's serialize function
}
```

In this case, `MyStruct` has a serialize function that manually appends the struct’s fields into the vector byte by byte. If you have a complex structure with more types, you can extend the serialize function to handle them as needed.
4. Handling Complex Types with Multiple Fields:

If your struct contains more complex data types, such as arrays or pointers, you'd need to manage those elements as well. For example, you might serialize an array of integers as a sequence of int values, or you might need to handle dynamically allocated memory for strings or pointers.
Summary:

    For Primitive Types: You can directly append data using std::memcpy or serialize it with byte-order conversion if needed (e.g., using htonl(), htons(), etc.).

    For Complex Types (like Structs): You should serialize them into a byte stream manually, either field by field or by using std::memcpy. If your struct contains multibyte data types, remember to handle byte order conversion (if necessary).

    Byte Order Handling: For cross-platform communication, ensure that the data is in the expected byte order (network byte order, usually big-endian). This applies particularly to multi-byte data types like int, float, double, etc.

    Custom Serialization: For more complex types, like structs or arrays, define a custom serialization function that breaks down the data into a stream of bytes and appends it to the vector.

With these adjustments, you should be able to append both primitive and custom data types to a `std::vector<Uint8>`. If you need further assistance with specific data types or have more questions about serialization, feel free to ask!

great recommendations. so i can also manually set number of bytes that certain structs take right? exactly tell the program how many bytes to use to write a struct and use the same technique on the other side to read it
<br><br>ChatGPT said:

Yes, absolutely! You can manually set the number of bytes that certain structs take, and this is a common approach in network programming or situations where you need to serialize data to a specific format. When doing this, you are in control of how data is serialized into bytes, which gives you the flexibility to precisely define how many bytes to use for a struct and how to deserialize it on the other side.
Manually Specifying the Number of Bytes for a Struct

The idea is that you can control the memory layout of your struct and determine exactly how many bytes you want to use for each field. This is often done to match specific binary formats or to ensure compatibility across different systems, especially in network communication.

For example, if you have a struct like this:
```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;      // 4 bytes
    float value; // 4 bytes
};
```

The total size of `MyStruct` is 8 bytes (4 bytes for the int and 4 bytes for the `float`), but you can also control how many bytes to serialize, whether by manually controlling alignment or omitting certain data.
Example 1: Manually Specifying the Size of the Struct

You can explicitly serialize the struct by controlling the number of bytes written to the vector using `std::memcpy` or other techniques.

```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;      // 4 bytes
    float value; // 4 bytes

    // Serialize the struct manually
    void serialize(std::vector<Uint8>& out) const {
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(id));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(id)], &id, sizeof(id)); // Serialize 'id'

        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(value));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(value)], &value, sizeof(value)); // Serialize 'value'
    }

    // Deserialize the struct manually
    static MyStruct deserialize(const std::vector<Uint8>& in, size_t& offset) {
        MyStruct data;
        std::memcpy(&data.id, &in[offset], sizeof(data.id)); // Deserialize 'id'
        offset += sizeof(data.id);

        std::memcpy(&data.value, &in[offset], sizeof(data.value)); // Deserialize 'value'
        offset += sizeof(data.value);

        return data;
    }
};
```
Key Points:

    Serialization: In the serialize function, you control the byte-wise serialization of the struct. You can resize the vector and use std::memcpy to manually append each field of the struct.

    Deserialization: In the deserialize function, you manually read the corresponding bytes into the struct. You also update the offset to ensure that the next data field is correctly placed in memory.

Example 2: Using Explicit Field Sizes

If you're dealing with a struct that requires precise byte size management, for example, you may need to control padding or alignment manually:
```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;      // 4 bytes
    float value; // 4 bytes
    char name[10]; // 10 bytes (static array)

    // Manually specify the number of bytes for each field
    void serialize(std::vector<Uint8>& out) const {
        // Append `id` (4 bytes)
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(id));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(id)], &id, sizeof(id));

        // Append `value` (4 bytes)
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(value));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(value)], &value, sizeof(value));

        // Append `name` (10 bytes)
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(name));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(name)], name, sizeof(name));
    }

    // Manually deserialize each field (remember to keep track of the offset)
    static MyStruct deserialize(const std::vector<Uint8>& in, size_t& offset) {
        MyStruct data;

        // Deserialize id (4 bytes)
        std::memcpy(&data.id, &in[offset], sizeof(data.id));
        offset += sizeof(data.id);

        // Deserialize value (4 bytes)
        std::memcpy(&data.value, &in[offset], sizeof(data.value));
        offset += sizeof(data.value);

        // Deserialize name (10 bytes)
        std::memcpy(data.name, &in[offset], sizeof(data.name));
        offset += sizeof(data.name);

        return data;
    }
};
```
In this case:

    Explicit Field Sizes: You manually specify how many bytes each field takes (e.g., 10 bytes for name).
    No Worries About Padding: If you control the exact field sizes (i.e., you don’t rely on compiler padding), you can ensure that the struct always takes up the same number of bytes.

3. Controlling Serialization for Non-Trivial Types:

If you have non-trivial types such as strings, arrays, or pointers in your struct, you will need to manually serialize them as well. For example, strings are dynamically allocated and their size may vary, so you need to handle them differently.

Example: Handling a string in the struct:
```c++
struct MyStruct {
    int id;
    std::string name;

    void serialize(std::vector<Uint8>& out) const {
        // Serialize 'id' (4 bytes)
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(id));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(id)], &id, sizeof(id));

        // Serialize the length of the string (4 bytes)
        size_t nameLength = name.size();
        out.resize(out.size() + sizeof(nameLength));
        std::memcpy(&out[out.size() - sizeof(nameLength)], &nameLength, sizeof(nameLength));

        // Serialize the string data
        out.resize(out.size() + nameLength);
        out.insert(out.end(), name.begin(), name.end());
    }

    static MyStruct deserialize(const std::vector<Uint8>& in, size_t& offset) {
        MyStruct data;

        // Deserialize 'id' (4 bytes)
        std::memcpy(&data.id, &in[offset], sizeof(data.id));
        offset += sizeof(data.id);

        // Deserialize the length of the string (4 bytes)
        size_t nameLength;
        std::memcpy(&nameLength, &in[offset], sizeof(nameLength));
        offset += sizeof(nameLength);

        // Deserialize the string data
        data.name = std::string(in.begin() + offset, in.begin() + offset + nameLength);
        offset += nameLength;

        return data;
    }
};
```
Key Points for Complex Types:

    Dynamic Size Fields: For fields like std::string, you need to first serialize the length of the string (e.g., size_t), followed by the string's content.
    Manual Control: When dealing with dynamically allocated memory or variable-length fields, you have to serialize the size and content separately, making sure you can deserialize it correctly on the other side.

Example of Byte Order Control:

If you need to ensure a certain byte order (like network byte order), you should serialize fields manually as well. For example, for a 32-bit integer, you can use `htonl()`:
```c++
data.id = htonl(data.id);
```
Conclusion:

Yes, you can definitely specify the exact number of bytes used by a struct. Here’s a quick recap:

    Manual Byte Size: For simple structs with fixed sizes, you can manually serialize the data using std::memcpy and specify the exact number of bytes.
    Complex Structs: For complex types (e.g., strings, arrays), manually handle the serialization/deserialization process, making sure you manage the size and content correctly.
    Byte Order: When sending data over the network, ensure correct byte order (e.g., using htonl(), htons(), etc.) for multibyte fields.

This approach allows you to precisely control the memory layout for both sending and receiving data, ensuring the program behaves consistently across different systems.
